title: Update 2

I've created a simple app, which uses 3 public APIs ([IP Geolocation API](https://ip-api.com/), [OpenLayers
](https://openlayers.org/), and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)) and shows the weather when you click on any place on the map.

You also can choose if you want to see the temperature in Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F).

Link on the app: (http://weathermap.pythonanywhere.com/)

The next task will be to post documentation on Swagger.
